    <p>We live in interesting times. As software developers we have access to a lot
      of powerful<br> tools which other people donâ€™t. One of these tools is Static
      Site Generators. However,<br> the big problem with static site generators
      is that of accessibility. Setting up an SSG site is tedious.<br> Updating
      it is even more so. We are building the tools to make SSGs more accessible.
      And would love to hear<br> your feedback on how we can get there!</p>
