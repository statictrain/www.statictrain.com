## Hello, World!

We live in interesting times. As software developers we have access to a lot of powerful
tools which other people don't. One of these tools is Static Site Generators. However,
the big problem with static site generators is that of accessibility. Setting up an SSG site is tedious.
Updating it is even more so. We are building the tools to make SSGs more accessible. And would love to hear
your feedback on how we can get there!
